# GitHub Tutorial

## Git vs. GitHub  
* **Git** is something that runs in the command line. It is version control, which  
keeps "snapshots" of code. However, it does not require github.  

* **Github** is the thing we use to store that code in the cloud.  
It is a way to  visually track the changes we make to the code.
